I've decided to leave neocities again. i realized that im really not gaining anything from using it as a webhost. i still like a lot of the sites hosted on neocities, but for my needs, github pages is all i need. at least as long as i cant afford to self-host a webserver to make more cool stuff with. github pages can do most things neocities does, but for free. main difference is that youre forced to leave the repo public which im not a fan of, but i guess its better than paying 5 bucks a month for essentially the same service.

also my website decided to break for no reason, which is the main reason why i tried switching but now i need to figure out a new workflow to properly deploy this site to github.
