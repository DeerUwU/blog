So im pretty sure im not alone with this but.. why do i listen to songs until ive sucked out every bit of joy i got from listening to it? I want to keep enjoying the songs i like forever!! So to understand this problem i decided to do a little bit of research to answer the following questions:

>1. why do we enjoy listening to music?
>2. why do we grow tired of songs?
>3. will i ever reach a point where no music excites me anymore?
>4. is there something i can do to avoid that?

### Why do we enjoy Music?
<hr class="dashed"/>

As a starting point, i read through an article highlighting some of the important, chemical factors and responses in the brain, regarding music.
<br/>
Music stimulates many different regions in the brain responsible for things like auditory processing, pattern recognition and emotional regulation.[^1]
<br/>
Music is... sounds. so naturally, music derives its qualities from sounds. 
The roar of a wild animal for example signifies danger and could trigger our fight or flight response. The sound of a crying baby could trigger parental instincts. Sounds communicate so many different things, its no surprise they trigger responses from the brain. 
Meanwhile from an evolutionary standpoint, music itself couldve been used as a tool for social bonding, strengthening relationships, leading to better group cohesion and improved survival.[^2] 
<br/>
All of this is linked to pattern recognition, an important survival instinct. Music takes advantage of our pattern recognition and your brain rewards you with dopamine for deconstructing songs to find those patterns.[^3] 

<br/><br/>
### Why do we get tired of songs?
<hr class="dashed"/>

The "caudate nucleus" <small>(associated with motor processes, learning and the reward system[^4])</small> anticipates the build-up of a song as you listen, while the "nucleus accumbens" <small>(also part of the reward center[^5])</small> releases endorphins <small>(hormones that help relieve pain, reduce stress and improve mood[^6])</small>.
<br/>
Listening to a song on repeat causes it to lose its novelty due to overexposure. You become bored once you're too familiar with it. The complexity of a song can also be a key factor. simple music may be more immediately accessible, but can lose its appeal quicker than a more complex song.[^7]
<br/>
Something interesting to note from my research is that the fall-off of enjoyment you receive from listening to a song is not linear, but rather a bell curve. Starts off low, peaks somewhere in the middle but ultimately a song will lose its spark.[^8]
<br/>
The same meta study also mentions that two different regions in the brain are involved when listening to familiar music compared to unfamiliar music. so i suppose once youre past the reinforcement stage from pattern recognition in the brain, the processing is passed onto the "superior frontal gyrus", which doesnt release the same chemical responses as "the left insula" and the "right anterior cingulate cortex".
<br/>
To be honest this whole topic might be a little too complex for me. Im just an idiot on the internet with a smooth marble for a brain. This is my best interpretation. Next question.

<br/><br/>
### Could i get sick of music in general?
<hr class="dashed"/>

Turns out, "musical burnout" is a real thing :\(
From what ive found it impacts people who are incredibly passionate about music more than casual listeners. People who seek out every new release, and constantly look for new artists, genres and styles. People who listen to a ton of music and overanalyze things.

<br/><br/>
### What can you do about it?
<hr class="dashed"/>
So first thought that came to my mind is "can i erase my memories of a song?"
surprisingly enough, my search didnt come up empty. It's not as simple as deleting a folder on your pc but according to [*The Healthy*](https://www.thehealthy.com/aging/mind-memory/how-to-erase-a-memory/), the brain removes unused synaptic connections in your sleep. All you have to do is... not think about something and focus on other things. In other words literally just go "i forgor 💀"
<br/>
Small tangent but i found this [interesting little article](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-figured-out-how-to-to-erase-your-painful-memories) talking about how blocking norepinephrine receptors while recalling traumatic experiences or being exposed to phobias can help dampen the negative emotional response to those things.
<br/>
Ok real talk - things that were suggested online to help avoid musical burnout:
>- avoid listening to music for extended periods (1 week - 1 month)
>- take care of yourself (eat healthy, sleep enough, spend time with friends and family)
>- dont just listen to the same song on repeat, listen to a variety of songs. Listen to full albums, even if you dont love every single song
>- find similar songs that you enjoy
>- explore new music
>- create new memories and associations with the songs you enjoy

All of this is easier said than done because it requires some self control but yknow its better than nothing.
