wow, im 22 now. cant believe ive made it this far tbh. yeah its my birthday today. 

I should be happy but i cant help but feel miserable. ive accomplished nothing in 22 years. ive done nothing with my life ever since i got fired last year. everyone i know either has a job, is getting their education or the support they need. i have nothing. not even an excuse. i should be perfectly capable of living a normal life. i have no physical disabilities, a roof over my head and in the eyes of the government i have enough money (i have no income). *clearly i dont need any support.* i dont have a therapist either. im terrified of therapists due to my past experiences so finding one is hard. doesnt help that the few times ive tried to find one i kept getting ghosted. why am i like this? why cant i do anything? why cant i get any help? idk how to move forward in my life so ill just keep coping through distractions.
<br/>
so what else is going on rn? im still not working on my game. ive picked up a couple smaller, managable projects instead. mainly this website, and now a tf2 hud that i already had sitting around. made it for a commission but the commissioner only paid for half of it since i asked for it upfront and then they kinda ghosted me. they told me theyd prefer to keep the hud private, but also they didnt pay me fully like we agreed. so im turning this into an edit, just to make it a bit more distinct. not sure if thats morally agreeable but if i cant fully get paid i want to at least see my mods be used.
<br/>
speaking of hud commissions, couple months ago i got commissioned to make a healthbar mod for deadlock. i delivered and the person was happy and they paid me so everything is cool, but since the game is in active development, valve keeps pushing updates that break the mod every other week. im so tired of maintaining a mod for a game i dont want to play anymore. maybe someone else can pick it up, i dont know. im tired.
<br/>
i wish i could pick one or two things to be good at rather than being mediocre at everything. doesnt matter if its gaming or art or music or something entirely different. but theres just so much cool stuff to do and i wanna do everything...

thanks for reading all of this. sorry for the vent, next post should be more lighthearted again.
