I wish I had a better relationship with my mom. Id love to make an effort to improve things but i feel like theres no hope to improve things.
She is bigoted and has many harmful conservative views on the world, and people. I hate that. 
She has never made an effort to try and understand me. And by the looks of it, that isnt going to change.

There are so many horrible parents... It feels like good parents only exist in cartoons like the owl house. Camila is a wonderful person and i wish i could have someone like her in my life.

Would it be too much to ask to just be accepted the way i am?
