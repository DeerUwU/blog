Am i a perfectionist? No matter how hard i try i always end up unsatisfied with my work. my drawings are never good enough, my music feels boring and uninspired, my code is buggy and my websites are lifeless. 

But...
all of this has an upside: i never stop trying to improve, to make the next drawing cooler, the next song more fun to listen to, to make the next website more unique and full of soul. Ill never stop trying, even if ill never be contempt with what i have created. 

I dont know if it would be better if i could just be happy with my work. Would i lose my drive to improve? I feel like sysiphus rolling the boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down once i think ive reached the top. I even get the urge to delete my old things because i cant stand looking at them. 
Wish i didnt. Still do it. blegh.
