i miss when people were hopeful about the future. do you remember that time? life seemed so full of possibilities and all the biggest companies in the world were competing to provide the best products for consumers. now, the big companies have figured out how to screw over and exploit every single one of their customers and squeeze them for their last penny and then some. its not a brave take, but... capitalism fucking sucks and im tired of pretending that its fine.  you cant buy software, its all subscription based. you pay more than ever before and they still feed you ads and track your data to squeeze even more money out of you. and when youre broke, why dont you try gambling to get your money back! its easier than ever! you will own nothing and you wont be happy either.

personally i believe that open source is the future. its a world of limitless potential, but it does come with its flaws. it relies on (usually) unpaid hobbyists maintaining software thanklessly for years. and a lot of open source projects tend to neglect the user experience design. it takes developers to create software, and developers are usually not designers. the pinnacle of what open source can be is probably blender. its an incredible piece of software. its functional and has a clean UI, you can hardly ask for more. then theres programs like krita that are great, but simply dont have the same amount of funding so development takes forever (the last major release was already over 2 years ago, and not much has changed since then). gimp couldve been good, but they dont do much to improve their user experience either. the text tool for example is a pain point in many of these creative programs for some reason.

if i could, i would switch to linux and never look back. unfortunately its too unstable and ive never had any luck with running it, although i dont see myself ever going back to windows after windows 10 becomes unusable. phones fucking suck too. you get no freedom and they try to feed you all this bloatware. no i dont want ai no i dont want to be forced to install tiktok and amazon fuck off.

today i tried to flash a custom rom on my phone to escape all of this. big mistake. turns out, its just as convoluted and difficult as it always has been. first i tried to look for an OS that supports my device in the first place, which turned out to be surprisingly difficult. then i looked up what you need to actually install it. twrp? magisk? whats that? unlock my bootloader? download a leaked flashing program from sketchy unofficial websites so i can flash a twrp version maintained by a single random dude? download a copy of my firmware from some other shady website? and if you fuck up anywhere you risk bricking your device? SIGN ME UP!!! actually i ended up giving up. im a pretty tech-savvy person myself and i couldnt get this to work. even just rooting your device involves like 30 steps with aforementioned leaked flashing software (odin, for those interested) and magisk. i tried it and it didnt even work in the end. all i got after wasting my whole day on this was a phone i need to set up again and i even lost 20 bucks because at some point during the 5th required factory reset it turned on data roaming without my knowledge and immediately used up all my credit. WHY IS THERE NO WARNING FOR THIS!!

anyways sorry for the rant i just hate how things are going. didnt even get to talk about ai, thats a whole different can of worms. <small>(more like an entire ocean of worms)</small>
