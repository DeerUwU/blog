Well... this is the start. I dont know who will read this or if anyone besides me will ever read this at all. But if you happened to stumble across this journal, hello. 

So why am I starting this journal? Ill be honest - i dont know. Something compelled me to do it. I want to write down my shower thoughts and alike. And maybe ill be able to look back on this and learn something about myself. 

I want to be many things - an artist, a musician, a video editor, a game developer, an animator, a story teller. An inspiration, a shoulder to lean on, someone to look up to, someone who never gives up. I want to be understood... Im sure you do too. You're not alone, whatever you might be going through. Life is rough but giving up is not the answer.. right?

Im not much of a writer, but i still wanna share my thoughts here. A little corner of the internet just to myself.
