thought dump again. hello.
<br/>
i dont even know if i should continue this website. im making my private thoughts public and im sharing my vulnerable side with strangers. its not the smartest decision. i know i wouldnt be able to keep up with a regular journal, id get lazy too quickly. i also simply dont like having a physical journal either. ive always been a pretty online person. making physical art or writing would leave it open to be discovered by my parents, at least when i was younger. i was afraid of that. and for as long as i live with my mom i probably wont be able to shake off that mindset. i grew up in a toxic environment both in school and at home so the internet has always been my safespace. the internet feels free of consequences <small>(not that i would abuse that for nefarious reasons)</small>. and yet i still cant shake the feeling that this could come bite me in the ass, even if what im writing here is ultimately harmless. i dont know. im a little paranoid when it comes to these things. 
<br/>
this isnt what i was gonna write about when i thought about making an update in the shower earlier but thats how things goes. i can settle for mediocrity in these journal entries.  or can i? i dont know. nothing i do ever feels like its ever good enough so im stuck always chasing to make something better in attempt to create my magnum opus, the one project that will finally make me feel whole. complete. contempt in life. all of this is probably in vein but the alternative for me would to jump infront of a train so for now ill keep chasing this unreachable goal.
