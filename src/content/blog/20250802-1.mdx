Today i want to talk about the legend of korra. (this will contain some spoilers for season 1 & 2).
<br/>
Its great to see a continuation of the avatar universe, but korra doesnt do the original show justice. its hard to point out exactly whats wrong. its almost like a gut feeling. the writing quality is all over the place. some episodes are great and build ontop of the universe in a wonderful way, others just feel like theyre puppetteering the spirit of the original show without understanding what made it so great. i think the best examples for that are general iroh (the guy who sounds just like zuko) and uncle iroh himself. general iroh will never be zuko. and iroh, living in the spirit world, just feels... off. its the same character, but he's not himself. i was happy to see him back but it feels more like fanservice. 
<br/>
its not just the writing, but also the pacing of the show. sometimes its good, sometimes things happen too fast with too little explanation. avatar the last airbender understood pacing perfectly, and allowed their characters to grow and become better. korra however often has things happening without any meaning. amon was a great villain who didnt get enough show runtime in my opinion. i wouldve loved to see a slower arc over the span of two seasons rather than things escalating into a full on war in just a few episodes. meanwhile in season 2 korra's big threat is some kite shaped spirit with 0 motivation or backstory. its evil because its red and black and because its the other side of a coin, not because it has any reason to act the way it does. i couldnt care less about that thing besides being the big evil of the season. when korra opened the first spirit portal, they used their hopeful inspirational music and everyone was happy but from the audience perspective, korra went into the avatar state and touched a glowing ball. she didnt learn anything, she didnt face a real challenge that couldve allowed her to grow as a person, she just did it and that was it.
<br/>
even the worldbuilding feels *off*. i love the steampunk aesthetic and republic city is a cool place. things make sense, but it doesnt capture the same charm as the last airbender did. <small>(Im no expert so take what i say with a grain of salt Here.)</small><br/>
That show was rooted in asian culture and it showed in every aspect of the world. from the spiritual beliefs, rituals and ceremonies to even the architecture, clothing and culture within the show. it was a well rounded experience for the viewer. korra carries over some of those aspects, given that it is a sequel, but its a westernized interpretation of it. the last airbender showed spirits as mystical beings that cared about specific things, and their morals were ambiguous. in korra, spirits are all black and white. either theyre good, or theyre evil. happy or sad. theres no nuance and it shows.
<br/>
dont get me wrong, the show is not bad but its unable to leave the last airbender's shadow.
