I rarely leave my comfort zone. The world is scary. Things are scary. People are scary. Even with this website im leaving my comfort zone. I dont even know how to use Astro! What is anything?? Its so different from the raw html and js im used to! Im quickly overwhelmed by things outside my comfort zone. Even this website is overwhelming. 
I wanted to make it a little prettier by adding particles but I dont have the slightest clue how anything works. Ill figure it out... probably... bwah... Its fine everything is fine im gonna figure it out and it will look awesome and ill be happy and
