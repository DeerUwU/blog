My life wouldnt be half as bad if i didnt get bullied in school. I know i should just "get over it" or whatever but its a lot harder than it should be... 

If i was only lonely it would be one thing but having everyone walk over you every day because they know there will be no consequences is so soul crushing. Even by people i considered to be friends at one point turned on me to make my life hell for 5 years. In all those years, only one person ever came up to me and apologized for their actions. I still remember your words and I wont forget them, Jan. Thank you. 

My parents weren't any help either unfortunately. Go to school, get bullied. Go home, get verbally abused and punished for the most trivial things like unloading the dishwasher in "the wrong order" or wiping the floor in a pattern that wasnt up to my dad's likings. The only escape i had from my life was the internet. The only place where people actually listened to me, treated me like a real person and didn't take out all their frustrations on me just to make my life more miserable. Online communities are truly special. If it wasn't for these kindhearted people i'd probably be dead already.

I still have trouble making friends outside the internet, but maybe ill get better at it one day. Something i also want is to have more *offline* hobbies. Things like sewing, making accessories or playing instruments, maybe. Those things are objectively cool, u cant convince me otherwise.

My tip for anyone still in school getting bullied: don't wait for someone else to step up for you - stand up for yourself. Get back at them, show them that messing with you will bring consequences. Put gross shit in their backpack when they're not looking, trip them up when they walk past. Steal their homework. 

And if all else fails? Punch them!!! The only language some people understand is violence. Thats the ugly truth no one wants to admit.
