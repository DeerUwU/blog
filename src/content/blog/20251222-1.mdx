tldr - cool free game you should check out.
[Welcome To The Dark Place](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135700/Welcome_To_The_Dark_Place/) is a new game by Zeekerss (creator of Lethal Company). on the surface its an unassuming, mostly text-based game about exploring "The Dark Place". my friend Caddie suggested it to me so i checked it out. i didnt think id enjoy it, but it has a surprising amount of depth, especially for a free game. Im not gonna go into any big spoilers but there really is a lot to explore. if you wanna see most of what the game has to offer, i recommend using something like a spreadsheet instead of the built in map, its just not enough to take note of everything you get to experience.

yeah i felt like talking about the game cause i had more fun than i expected, even as someone without a vivid imagination. i cant resist exploration games where you have to create your own maps to navigate the world in any meaningful way, like yume nikki (and yume 2kki, by extension). but the game is fun even without this level of commitment.

 okay okay, enough about that game. what am *_i_* up to? MEGASTRUCT (working title) is going well, despite the slow development. ive implemented a basic GOAP ai system (goal oriented action planning for the enemies) and while its not the easiest system to work with, im hoping that ill be able to create some intelligent enemies and creatures for the game. im considering making devlogs either on this website or in the form of youtube videos. but im not sure, but im thinking about it.... id definitely be more comfortable with written devlogs, but youtube devlogs would help get the word out about the game. maybe thats for later though, since i havent even made the discord server public.
