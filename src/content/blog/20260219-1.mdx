so.... archiving is pretty important. you never know when something online might disappear due to copyright claims, platforms and services shutting down or the creator simply privating/deleting their own content for whatever reasons. its not unlikely that even your own youtube playlists look like this:
<br/>
<div class="flow-center flow-down"> ![screenshot of my youtube playlist showing 8 unavailable videos](/images/blog/20260219-1.png)<small>(stick around to the end, ill tell you how to find these)</small></div>
<br/>

this is actually way more common than you might think. even games are affected by this, when they are no longer being sold. theres a lot of cases where emulation is the only way to play these games.
<br/>
so what can you do? 
archive it! if you care about something, download it. try to save the highest quality version you can find. if you want to go the extra mile, make sure to include everything like the cover image, description, upload date, download source etc. 
and if you notice that something youve archived is no longer available online, reupload it! (if you can, of course.)

*"so how can i archive media?"*

im glad you asked! for music & videos, try [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). its versatile and can download from a huge range of platforms like youtube, soundcloud, reddit, bandcamp and many many more. if you dont like using the command line, you can also get a [gui version](https://github.com/dsymbol/yt-dlp-gui). some important custom arguments to use are 
- `-f ba` (download best available audio audio format, if youre downloading music)
- `--embed-metadata` (self explanatory, hopefully)
<br/>
to archive art or music cover art, see [how to extract the original images from platforms](../20250728-1)
<br/>

> its important to make sure you do your best to preserve media in losselss formats like `.wav`, `.flac` or `.png`.

 **<p class='shake'>PLEASE</p> please please** also archive your own work!! you never know when your own harddrives could die! please make backups on different drives and use version control or cloud storage or anything like that. 

and if youre trying to find something that has already been lost, try sites like the internet archive & wayback machine. 
<br/>
as promised, ill also tell you how to find those missing videos from your youtube playlists. first, click the 3 vertical dots and select "show unavailable video". next, click on one of the unavailable videos and copy the url and paste them into this site: https://findyoutubevideo.thetechrobo.ca. it will show you if theres an available archived version of it (or at least the video's metadata).
