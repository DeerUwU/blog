Animal Well. <br/>
Its such a wonderful game.
It has such a unique identity in every aspect. from the gameplay to the environments. I dont wanna spoil anything about the game here so ill stay vague. I can only recommend playing it for yourself. On the surface level it looks like just a fun puzzle platformer game, but if you pay close attention to detail you will see just how deep the rabbit hole goes. 
<br/>
The game is designed in layers. Layer 1 is the base game itself, from start to finish. Any player should be able to beat it. Layer 2 is about finding all the secret eggs. This is also reasonably doable for most players, if they're willing to put in the time. Layer 3 however starts to become far more obscure and for most of the game you wont even be aware that these things exist. more observant players will probably run into some parts of it, but most people wont notice things. This is also where i called it quits. things were getting too complex and well hidden for me. 
<br/>
This is where the spoilers start.
<br/>
<span class="spoiler">I myself only managed to find 14 out of 16 secret bunnies & 3 unicode messages without any help before i gave up. I kinda wish i couldve solved layer 3 on my own but i think i can appreciate what i managed to achieve. I ended up watching Furyforged's videos on layer 3 and 4 and yeah theres no way i couldve solved the rest on my own hahah. </span>

So yeah now im "done" with the game. What else is there to do? well.. the developer billy basso shared clips of the game's development in a couple interviews/ pre release footage and it was so interesting to see how different it was. I dont remember how i found this but here's a prototype trailer from 2019.

If you've played the game, some rooms might look vaguely familiar but thats about it. After seeing this i absolutely wanted to get my hands on an alpha version. so i tried if i could download older versions through steam manifest ids. unfortunately not, and thats where my search stopped, for about a year. About a week ago i started playing again, for fun. And i got curious about the alpha versions again so i did some research. turns out, it actually WAS possible to download beta versions.. at least for a couple weeks when the game first launched, before people noticed and it got locked. But this meant that i actually had a shot at finding a version. so i did more research. surely there had to be a reupload somewhere, right? nope. i couldnt find ANYTHING about the alpha versions except a reddit post from over a year ago, and [stream videos from furyforged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QUaB4Vx7xc&list=PLhswFeCZrtXsAPsPARoRZnDWI2t8HYIBM). I searched several cut/beta content related forums and archives and found nothing. things were not looking good for my quest. as a last resort, i contacted a couple people ive seen discuss alpha builds and to my surprise, someone still had the build i was after! 
<br/>
tldr i wanted to find a beta build and after some struggles i found one.
<br/>
The build in question is from august 31st, 2022. almost 2 years before release. it was so fascinating to see how much has changed in that timeframe. billy really polished the game a ton. the 2022 build cant even be completed legitimately. he overhauled most sound effects, created new music, to added all the post game puzzles and secrets and fixed a bunch of quirks and silly bugs. its this attention to detail that really makes the game special in my eyes. Sorry for rambling about this game so much, i dont really know anyone who cares about the game so much. Now im currently working on my own custom map for the game. we'll see if i finish this project.
