I replaced the journal titles. I dont give my own thoughts titles, so why should these entries get one? I know you can easily figure out what the titles say, if you *really* want. Thats not the point. Anyways I made art today. Hope I can figure out how to embed it on this page. I feel like i could work on it for another 5 hours but ill call this one done... for now. Im actually procrastinating on game dev with this but its nice to draw things again. Its been a while.
