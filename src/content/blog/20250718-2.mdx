i always think i could do so much more for my friends. almost all of them are exclusively online. connecting with people irl is not my strength. I *do* have 1 (one) irl friend, but she lives far away :(

online however i have... too many friends. people generally seem to like my vibe. and all of these people are so lovely and sweet and kind and

but i just cant keep up with everyone equally. it sucks. they all deserve my love and attention but its more than i can give. is it my own fault for being stuck in this corner? i cant help it... i dont wanna push kind people away just because i already have nice people in my life. I HATE being rude, cold and distant. but i also feel like im forced to put up this facade to keep people from becoming attached to me when i know i cant give them the attention they deserve. they deserve to have better friends.

I understand this is more of a luxury problem. many people struggle to find any friends at all and here i am, complaining that i have too many. as ironic as it sounds, this problem is oddly isolating. irl im lonely, isolated and crave human connection, online i feel like i need to distance myself from people.
