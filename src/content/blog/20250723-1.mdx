Finding a username is... hard. and everyone needs one. what is the ideal username? in my opinion a good username should follow most of these criteria: 

1. Unique
2. Memorable
3. Short
4. Pronouncable
5. Personal

A good username doesn't have to follow *all* of these, but they should check at least some of them. I usually go by deer or cakeeh online, although i prefer deer. its short, memorable, pronouncable and personal because i love those little creatures ðŸ¦Œ. but it absolutely isnt unique and the only place where ive managed to get 'deer' as my username is jstris lol. cakeeh on the otherhand is... an old username. i dont like it as much. its short unique and memorable, but it just doesnt feel personal to me and no one knows how to pronounce it <small>(cakey)</small>. at least it's usually available.

Im curious...
how did **YOU** come up with **YOUR** username?
