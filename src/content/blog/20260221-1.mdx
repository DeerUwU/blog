<details>
	<summary>ShareX</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[ShareX](https://getsharex.com)</span> is a free screenshotting tool with many features. many years ago i used to use lightshot for my screenshotting needs. ShareX does everything it did, but better. my favorite features are drawing arrows, blurring sections or recording gifs. only negative points are that it doesnt support linux (for those who use it) and they recently added ai slop service integration. its optional but i dont like that its built in at all so i havent updated yet.

	<summary>Vivaldi</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com)</span> is a chromium based browser. theres not much to it, i picked it up in like 2017 or 2018 and ive been using it since. i like its tab stacking/tiling features and the left side panel that lets you attach websites, like a sort of hotbar. just use whatever browser u like, theres many options.
		<br/>

		- Windows
		- Linux

	<summary>Blender</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[Blender](https://www.blender.org)</span> is a free open source 3d modelling program for windows and linux. ive been actively using it since 2018 and its a great piece of software. the ui has also improved so much, a lot of other open source tools can learn a thing or two from blender's ui. 
		<br/>
		**Available on:**
		- Windows
		- Linux
		- macOS

	<summary>Godot</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[Godot](https://godotengine.org)</span> is a free open source cross-platform game engine for windows, linux and android. ive been working with it for 2 years now and its quite fun. the documentation is among the best ive seen for any tool, the development is pretty fast and the future is bright. Godot by default expects you to use their own python-like language called GDScript, but they also offer official support for C# and C++. if youre planning on using a lot of community addons, you might wanna stick to GDScript but otherwise i recommend using C# with an IDE like Jetbrains Rider 
		<br/>
		its still a little lacking in the 3d department though so it still has to catch up to other engines like source 2, unity and unreal. the rendering pipeline isnt very mature and a bit complex to use if you want to use the compositor with glsl instead of gdshaders, and theres no good 3d level creation tools so your best options are either func_godot (a trenchbroom importer), VMF importer for like source engine Hammer, or you make your own pipeline with blender. im sure for 2d games its perfectly capable though.

	<summary>AIMP</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[AIMP](https://aimp.ru)</span> is a freeware audio player. i used to use AIMP years ago when i had a very weak pc because its super lightweight and with plugins you can stream music from platforms like youtube, soundcloud and more. its honestly a lot better than i remembered. super lightweight, super customizable, and has a feature for just about anything i could ask for. and if it doesn't, theres probably a plugin for that.
		<br/>
		some of my favorite features are the skin & plugin support, song fading/transition options, playlist groups, the mini player, the advanced tag editor with online lookup support and custom text info strings.
		<br/>
		I specificly recommend using it with the [A4 skin](https://aimp.ru/?do=catalog&rec_id=832) and the [Hameleon plugin](https://aimp.ru/?do=catalog&rec_id=715).

		![Screenshot of AIMP with A4 and Hameleon](/images/blog/20260221-1/aimp.png)

		A4 is a very clean, modern theme. i saw theres also a different skin based on it called M5, if A4 is not 100% what you were looking for. Hameleon is a plugin that adds support for dynamic ui colors based on the current song's cover art.

	<summary>PureRef</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		[PureRef](https://www.pureref.com) is a freemium reference board program. its super handy for collecting... reference images and inspiration. it also allows you to draw on the board, which i often like to use for taking notes and whatnot.
		<br/>
		**Available on:**
		- Windows

	<summary>OBS</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[OBS](https://obsproject.com)</span> 
		is named after what it is. Open Broadcaster Software. its the most popular open source screen recording & streaming tool out there. its versatile, easy to use, and can be extended with plugins if needed. no complaints.
		<br/>
		**Available on:**
		- Windows
		- Linux
		- macOS

	<summary>Audacity</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org)</span>
		is a free, open source audio editing & recording program. its simple but effective and does what you need it to. a complete overhaul is being developed and i cant wait for it to be officially released. what im not a fan of though are the musehub ads and cloud service garbage theyve started including a couple years ago. i dont want ads for ai junk in my free software! other than that, good program.

		- Windows

<details>
	<summary>Trenchbroom</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[Trenchbroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io)</span>
		is a free open source level editor for quake-engine based games. i use it in conjunction with func_godot to create the maps for my game, since its pretty much the best solution to that problem right now. 
		<br/>
		trenchbroom is super fast for prototyping & texturing maps, but it lacks some tools and features that could make it even better. things like a basic lighting preview, box/lasso selection and  better tools to create curved geometry or staircases. <small>(you can find some prefabs to create complex geometry [here](https://spacehare.github.io/prefabs). this should be built into the editor tbh. )</small>
		<br/>
		since its made for quake-based engines, you unfortunately have to deal with 30 year old engine limitations too.

		- Windows

	<summary>Material Maker</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[Material Maker](https://www.materialmaker.org)</span>
		is an open source procedural texture creator built in godot. its probably the best Substance Designer competitor. it still has some flaws and lacks some features that Substance Designer has, but its getting better with every update.
		it also includes a texture painter like Substance Painter, but i havent tried it so i cant comment on that.
		<br/>

	<summary>Krita</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[Krita](https://krita.org/en/)</span>
		is my drawing software of choice. i simply like its ui controls and gmick adds tons of neat filters i like to use for my artworks. sometimes i also use it to simply edit some stuff if i dont feel like opening photoshop. but typically i do one last post processing pass in photoshop using their Camera RAW editor to dial in the color balance, add grain & vignette etc. 
		<br/>
		biggest downsides are the text tool & slow development. the text tool is awful. a while ago i tried a nightly build which updates the text tool, but it also adds very weird controls i dont understand the purpose of. didnt really make it better to use. open source software often struggles with text tools, for some reason.

	<summary>FL Studio</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com)</span>
		is a DAW, used for creating music. ive tried a bunch of DAWs and FL & Ableton were my favorites. unfortunately i no longer have my copy of Ableton so im using FL. its fun to use, but very expensive if you want to buy it. (especially with all plugins).

		if youre just trying to get into digital music production, i recommend that you simply try out a bunch of different DAWs to see which ones you like the most. if youre looking for a free one, check out Reaper or Cakewalk Sonar

	<summary>OpenRGB</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		<span class="link">[OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org)</span>
		is an open source RGB lighting control program. instead of downloading like a dozen different bloated programs from every manufacturer, get this one and set up your RGB however you want. it supports a huge list of hardware & peripherals, has plugin support and you can create profiles to easily change things up without reconfiguring your lighting every time.

	<summary>Honorable Mentions</summary>
	<div class="details_content">
		some of them not so honorable but whatever. 
		<br/>
		<span class="link">[itch.io](https://itch.io)</span> is an "indie game hosting marketplace". in other words its kinda like steam, with a larger focus on selling indie titles. unlike steam, itch doesn't have an upfront $100 fee to put your game up and you can even play certain games directly in your browser, if the creators allow it. i dont use itch.io that much but occasionally you can pick up huge game bundles for pretty cheap (like this currently ongoing bundle: https://itch.io/b/3484/no-ice-in-minnesota)
		<br/>

		Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, Substance Painter. adobe as a company sucks balls but the software is good and they satisfy my needs. 
		<br/>

		for discord i use Vencord as my client. its far more stable than something like Better Discord. anyways i hope discord dies soon so we can all move on to (hopefully better) platforms.
		<br/>

		for source engine modding i use VTFEdit, CGFScape, S2Viewer, Crowbar, Blender Source Tools and SourceIo. theyre all handy little tools.
		<br/>

		YT-DLP gets another shoutout here cause why not.
		<br/>

		I dont use it, but if you want a github alternative check out Codeberg. only drawback is that they *really* want you to only host open source stuff available to everyone. 
		<br/>

		for coding i use VS Code and Jetbrains Rider. VS Code for most things, Rider for C#. it has good native Godot Integration but i recommend turning off like 90% of the bundled plugins it comes with, you most likely wont ever need them.
		also fuck microsoft.
