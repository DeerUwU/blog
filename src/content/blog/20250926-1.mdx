It has probably been 10 years since ive heard this, but the quote *"sociopaths talk about themself way more than normal people"* has always stuck with me for some reason. Im always worried that i talk about myself too much. I know im neither a sociopath or a narcissist but i still cant help but overthink about this. Its not like im writing about someone else, and this is my website about whatever *i* want so does it really matter? i dont know.

anyways here's the song recommendation of the day:
