Talent is a concept that is commonly accepted as real. I dont believe talent exists. At least, not in the form that it is usually described as. Genereally speaking i dislike the idea of "talent". When someone is good at their craft or specialty, people often call them talented, but chalking it up to be just talent undermines all the hard work people put in to perfect their skills. The countless hours people spend practicing to get where they are.
