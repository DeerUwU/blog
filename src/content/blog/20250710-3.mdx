Being cringe isnt as bad as people make it out to be, honestly. 
> "To be cringe is to be free"

This resonates with me. What is being cringe really? Its simply about expressing yourself the way you are and not letting other people's opinions affect who you are. I admire people who have the strength and confidence to do that. People who do things outside the norm and show their passion for things most people would consider "cringe". I hope that one day i too will find the confidence to be myself regardless of what anyone might think.
