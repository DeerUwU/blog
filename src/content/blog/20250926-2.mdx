Its been a while, but i finally made (pixel) art again. didnt get much attention on [pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/art/rain-sr5z1b384acde6aws3) but its whatever. YOU can look at it now and pretend to press the like button or something. i dont actually need likes. i might make that artwork a gif with animated rain at some point, it would be cool.
<br/>
i wanted to make this page have different particles and play rain sounds but im too fucking stupid to figure things out in astro boowomp. <small>i wasted like 3 hours on this now and my particle plugin of choice is too simple for complex effects anyways. clearly the smart decision is to make a new website from scratch that is like 5% more scalable & flexible than this one, until i hit another wall and repeat the process like all the other times. im only half-joking, but im not gonna make a new website.</small> 
<br/>

yeah so anyways... im feeling stupid again. i get too ambitious with my project ideas and then i abandon them like a bad mom. and i have new ideas for projects now that i would love to start but deep down i know i would only abandon them too. that animal well map had potential but now i cant find the motivation anymore. doesnt help that it was impossible for me to know if i was headed in the right direction with the level design. the project filled me with an overwhelming amount of uncertainty. so instead of working on stuff i played tf2 all week. i dont know if i can pick up that project again. it stings to leave it unfinished but its hard.

you thought you're only getting one song recommendation today? well you thought wrong!
