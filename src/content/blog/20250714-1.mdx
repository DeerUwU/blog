ugh I feel like a fuckup again. i tried to make art, i tried to make music but its not meant to happen today i guess. the comment box still doesnt work either...
<small>(probably because i dont have neocities supporter)</small>

i learned a bit more about working with astro at least. 

i should be working on my game. id rather make textures or models or whatever but i really have to rework some core mechanics. i cant find the motivation to continue rn... if only my project partners hadnt abandoned the project. theyre sitll welcome to come back but this <span class="">*FUCKING*</span> sucks. its way too much work!! im too stubborn to give up so easily but it hurts my sanity

and making music is so hard too!!! any melody i come up is just something ive already heard before. i have no original ideas. it makes me feel worthless. sorry for ranting again.
