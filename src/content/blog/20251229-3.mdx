so... last post ended up being pretty long. i feel like the way i currently style my posts, the huge walls of text can become tedious to read. <img class="emote" src="/images/emotes/femtanyl_dance.gif"/> at least thats my perception. idk if i can make it more interesting by introducing more colors, text effects, more personality or similar things like that. <img class="emote" src="/images/emotes/Default_dance.gif"/> i should seriously experiment with that. maybe i can add better emote support so i can add dancing furry creatures every 2 sentences <img class="emote" src="/images/emotes/dancing_fella.webp"/>
