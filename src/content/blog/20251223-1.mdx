I hate discord and i hate that theres no better alternative. fuck nitro its so annoying. if you dont a custom client, please do yourself a favor and install one like, right now. i recommend [Vencord](https://vencord.dev). custom clients are  completely safe to use and theres no risk of getting banned, despite technically being against discord TOS. (unless you use plugins to self-bot or things like that, but youd have to go out of your way to do that)
<br/>
anyways here's some stuff you can add as custom CSS to get rid of annoying crap discord desperately tries to shove into your face.

```css showLineNumbers
[aria-label="Send a gift"], /* gift button */
[data-tab-id="Nitro Server Boost"],
[href="/quest-home"], /* friendslist button to quests */
[href="/store"], /* friendslist button to store */
[href="/shop"] /* friendslist button to shop */
{
    display: none;
}

/* settings menu */
[aria-label="Nitro"], /* (in legacy settings) */
[aria-label="Billing Settings"], /* nitro-related category*/
[data-settings-sidebar-item="family_center_panel"] /* family center tab*/
{
    display: none;
}

/* profile edit page */
[class*="-upsell"], /* nitro upsell banners */
[class*="-premiumFeatureBorder"], /* nitro try it out */
._8279f38edc620354-container /* shop banner */
{
    display: none;
}

/* pfp decorations */
[src*="avatar-decoration"] {display: none;}

/* profile animated popups 
(still visible when you hover over the profile, unfortunately) */
[class$="-profileEffects"] {display: none;}

/* nameplates */
[poster*="nameplate"],
[src*="nameplates"]
{
    display: none;
}
[class*="nameplated"] div:first-child {
    background: unset!important;
}
```
other annoying junk you might wanna get rid of:
```css showLineNumbers{43}
[aria-label="Checkpoint"], /* discord 'checkpoint' button */
[aria-label^="Server Tag"], /* server tags next to usernames */
[aria-label="Help"], /* help button */
[aria-label="Add Friends to DM"],
[aria-label="Start Video Call"],
[aria-label="Notification Settings"],
[data-settings-sidebar-item="family_center_panel"] /* settings menu family center */
{display: none;}

/* discovery button in server list */
[aria-label="Discover"] {display: none;}

/* invite to server right click option */
div#user-context-invite-to-server {
    display: none;
}
```
aside from that, i also recommend going into accessibility settings and disabling "display name styles" to get rid of animated usernames with custom fonts.

please leave any corrections, additions or ideas in the comments.
