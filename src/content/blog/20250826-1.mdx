So Making levels isnt actually hard. making *good* levels is hard. Im still working on my animal well custom map. i think im generally headed in the right direction but i can tell that some parts arent as good as i want them to be. It's complicated balancing act you have to master to create a good player experience. There are also a bunch of questions you have to ask yourself while designing levels.
<br/>
and making a custom map for a game like animal well is a unique challenge on its own. billy basso, the original developer could always operate under the assumption that new players dont know anything about the game and thus need to be taught every mechanic throughout the game. this can be done by locking progress behind a challenge that allows the player to discover the solution naturally through contextual clues like getting a new item and immediately being forced to use it to progress. and later in the game there can be more elaborate versions building on top of those concepts and ideas. but its also important to make sure the player understands that they can't solve something with the current tools or knowledge they have, otherwise it will leave them frustrated, trying to accomplish something they currently cant.
<br/>
for me however, i can't rely on the player not knowing how to do certain things like disc riding and consecutive bubble jumps. so i have to design my levels around the player already knowing these things, while also leaving in some ways for the players to discover these mechanics on their own, in case they dont know these things. 
<br/>
so how do you make compelling puzzles and challenges? there are some core concepts that should always be taken into consideration. actually executing these ideas well is definitely not easy. a good puzzle has a catch, or makes the player reassess what they currently know or assume. lets take a look at portal 2's puzzles for example. the chamber "triple laser" has a simple layout. you have 3 laser beams, and 3 laser receptors to open the door, and 2 redirection cubes. but you quickly realise that it already takes both your portals to get 1 laser in the receptor, and both cubes to get another laser in. the chamber **seems impossible**, until you reassess your approach. you can redirect multiple lasers with the same portal, allowing you to complete the chamber. then theres the chamber "rug pull". all you have is a cube, a laser, a raising platform and a closed door. the chamber **seems deceptively simple**. just move the cube out of the laser's path and place it on the button. the platform moves up and the door is open. but here's the catch: you cant get to the platform in time. the solution is to reposition the laser bridge the cube is initially placed on so you can delay dropping it on the button. 
<br/>
tldr make an obstacle that seems impossible at first or something that seems so simple it doesnt even look like a puzzle. both give the player a sense of discovery.
<br/>
animal well isnt linear and i dont want to make my own map linear either, which reintroduces some design difficulty. sadly the game doesnt have a lot of unused tiles, items or features as far as im aware and i cant code in my own features either, so that makes it a lot more challenging to subvert peoples expectations or create new scenarios that werent already explored in vanilla. I can make things unique by creating unique environments but thats about it. im also a little upset about some alpha features getting cut from the code entirely, like marking things on the map, falling spikes or some of the ghost enemies. okay i dont know what the point of this is anymore so ill stop here.
