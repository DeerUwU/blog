lets talk for a bit, its been a while. 
please check out petrapixel's indie web contest, it has lots of neat little websites to vote for! im also participating in it cause it felt like a fun thing to do (this is not a request to vote for my site, please vote for the sites you like) https://petrapixel.neocities.org/contest

#### Site Updates
<hr class="dashed"/>
aside from that.. plans for the website. website plans. the webbed site planning. i wanna add some new pages when i get around to do it. 
first will be a little gallery to show off my art, the second would be for my projects like my tf2 huds etc. 
another thing i wanna add is a page for music recommendations, i think that would be cool.. something like "please gimme \<cozy/energetic/chaotic\> music and then u get a random album or song to listen to."
<br/>
also wanna add some more functionality to the comment sections. first of all i wanna add a little badge next to my own comments to highlight that its actually me whos responding, and the second thing would be to add a little approval process before comments are displayed, so i can filter out spam or other malicious content before its displayed on my site.

#### Personal Updates

So what have i been up to? ive picked up my guitar again after not touching it for almost a decade. 
i quit playing initially because the instrument was forced onto me and i had a bad teacher, so i ended up learning nothing before quitting a year later. but now im learning on my own and im having fun with it. 
its a little hard to find the right resources to learn though, cause most places wanna sell you a course or subscription services and im so tired of that stuff. 
<br/>
ive been playing a lot of white knuckle too. great game, love it. highly recommend it. ive been speedrunning the campaign and hopefully i can make it to the top 10 at some point :3 (im 20th currently with a time of 9:59). 
<br/>
im also working a lot on my game again. its not easy but i wanna get it to a playable, fun state one day. ive considered making a discord for it but im unsure if i wanna invite people to it. it could either motivate me to keep working on it because people actually want to see me succeed, or it could demotivate me because i cant live up to peoples expectations because i got overwhelmed by the workload.
