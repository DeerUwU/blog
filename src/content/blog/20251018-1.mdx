i felt inclined to make a general update post on what ive been up to lately.
starting off - ive found a workflow im happy with so maintaining the site after the switch to github pages will remain as easy as before. and due to the poll results ive continued work on a game project that was on hiatus for a couple months. (dont expect much from me but yknow at least its being worked on.) ill still leave the poll open until i come up with a poll to replace it with. i also picked up my guitar again, after almost a decade. once ill get good at it ill be just like hitori from bocchi the rock fr. still hate how pressing down on the strings feels, but hopefully ill get over it. this time i dont have anyone nagging me over how im holding the instrument so ill be able to actually focus on learning how to play. awesome.
