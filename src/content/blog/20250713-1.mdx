Ughh Im fucking up my sleep schedule <small class="shake">(again)</small>... its already 6 am... Its ok its not like it has ever been stable for more than a week. Ive been trying to figure out how to make particles work but i just cant. Ughhhh. Ive done it before on an old website! But here? nothing works! And its not like i have anyone to ask for help. I hate this. But hey noticed the shaking text? (easy to miss, i know). Expect to see more of that in the future. Im gonna make this shit look like undertale dialogue!

Someone on neocities recommended this album called [K1LLPPL4FUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlfp8kYtaYM) by Adverrt. Ive been listening to it, its pretty cool <small>(and underrated)</small>. Makes me want to start making music again. Not sure how to actually learn music theory stuff or whatever you actually need to know to be remotely knowledgable about music production.
