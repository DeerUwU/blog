memes are everywhere and im tired of it. dont get me wrong, i like memes, but the internet is just SOO oversaturated with memes its exhausting. I dont wanna see memes in every single channel on every discord server im in. servers with 0 meme moderation are awful because no real conversations ever take place because its all just weird gifs and images. sometimes its nice to just talk about things.

maybe we're all just collectively trying to distract us from our own sadness by sharing funny images because the world sucks, i dont know.
