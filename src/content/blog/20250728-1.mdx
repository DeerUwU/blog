ever wanted to get music covers or posts in their original/better resolution? with some tricks you can actually do that.

a lot of music artists also upload their work on bandcamp so lets start with that one. just head to a song, right click the image and open it in a new tab. the url should look similar to this:
`https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0373407715_10.jpg`
<br/>
notice the `_10` at the end of the filename? bandcamp stores images in a range of different resolutions. to seperate them, it appends understcore and a number. changing the url to `_0` will give you the original!
<br/>
now lets try youtube community posts for example.
urls will look like this:

`https://yt3.ggpht.com/8AB4knZOv7dfGRVD54GyVWdiRT9rTq4khtzdtLzK1XpZPK0tq14EJzhDgb03EqHzW8zNiJMIbovGUw=s640-c-fcrop64=1,00380000ffeeffff-rw-nd-v1`
<br/>
seems a lot more confusing with all the numbers and values, BUT there is a little `w=s640` buried inside. w= suggests that its the image width. changing it to `w=s0` gives us the original resolution. sometimes the url also contains something like `fcrop64=1`. remove it to uncrop the image.
<br/>
sometimes, you can't just right click and open in a new tab. thats when you need to use the inspect element tool <small>(explaining how to use it goes beyond the scope of this post, look up a tutorial)</small>
<br/>

when you select the image, you should be able to see the url somewhere in the styles panel or inside the html element itself. you can open this one in a new tab. soundcloud images tend to append their resolution at the end aswell like this: `-t500x500.png`. ~~im not entirely sure how to get the original res image~~ you can get the original image by replacing that string with `original`.
<br/>
I hope this gives you an idea on how platforms store images and how you can identify patterns to get the highest quality images.
