Im sorry for all the heavy topics in the earlier posts. It's not all i want this page to be about, so today is gonna be more lighthearted. im happy with my progress. in a week i made the particles work, added a guestbook, added sounds and music and some settings to tweak things. 

But theres still a lot of quality of life improvements i want to add. 
>1. add a toggle to disable panel animations like fading and sliding
>2. add a button to change background music (maybe even an option to never change it again or changing it on every page)
>3. add a toggle to disable background blur since it can be resource intensive
>4. make the navbar a hamburger menu on mobile
>5. buttons to open a random journal entry, previous or next one
>6. tags? filtering?

and aside from that to make things more interesting. id love to make entries more unpredictable. maybe one day itll just be a site update, on the next its a song of the day, and on another theres some interactive thingy to play with.
