lots of thoughts today. 
<br/>
ive been watching a lot of older shows and movies recently, mostly stuff from memes but its nice. Watched Ratatouille, Shrek, the incredibles and American Psycho recently. No clue how incels can idolize Patrick Bateman, the guy only appears sympathetic for like 3 minutes before he starts acting like a total dickhead. that guy's a freak. as for the other movies, they were nice. shrek has pretty timeless humor even if the animation style looks quite dated nowadays. the other two movies are also great for a casual watch.
<br/>
silksong also came out today, im happy about it. managed to snag a copy before the servers started to die :3
turns out if you know the package id you can add any game to your cart on steam, even if its not out yet. you just wont be able to purchase it until its actually out and available. but yeah that saved me enough time.
im a little upset that they didnt leave any pre-release builds accessible through manifest ids but its okay. game is definitely fun.

ive been active on wplace for 2-3 weeks now and at first it was kinda fun but it has become impossible to ignore the moderation problems on the site. clearly they dont look at their reports because i ran into a guy with over 50 botted accoutns that ive reported multiple times over a week ago and they've done nothing about it. it fucking sucks.
