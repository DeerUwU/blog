Trying to write C++ code feels like a sick punishment compared to other languages. Ive been messing around with the animal well editor's source code and there's so much stuff id love to add, fix or improve but i dont have the brain capacity for it. you cant select multiple areas, you can't undo any actions besides tile placement, you cant rearrange full rooms (yet). dregu wrote an implementation for it but their code is private rn, hope they make a pull request for it soon. the lighting preview is alright but seems to apply fg ambient light incorrectly, making tiles brighter than they should be.
theres also no way to save preferences and the automatic backups clog up storage pretty quickly.
<br/>
and then there's maxwell, the cheat tool / modloader. i wanna mess around with its code but it seems even more confusing to look at. i want a version of it thats just a pure modloader, nothing else. having a bunch of powerful cheats at your disposal is very tempting. very good for testing my map though. yknow what im gonna give editing it a try.
